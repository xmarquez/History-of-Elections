This set of files contain the code for recreating the graphs in this post:

You will also need the PIPE dataset, which is available here:
https://sites.google.com/a/nyu.edu/adam-przeworski/home/data

You will need the file "Additional Data and Codes for PIPE.csv" to fix country names, add latitude, longitude, and region information, other codes, and franchise information for Russia.

Put the PIPE dataset in an appropriate Data directory, modify the directory in "Processing PIPE.R" accordingly, and then run the script.

To produce the graphs, run "Final Graphs.R"

If all goes well (which it probably won't) you should get something that looks much like the graphs in the post.
